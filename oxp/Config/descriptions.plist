	/* For each personality, define values for the communications keys
	 * set up in comms-pack-a.js. To add variety to the comms

	 * definitions, as well as the personality-based keys there are
	 * also role-based keys e.g. prefix commsPackA_hunter_ and generic

	 *
	 * These might be used exclusively - e.g.
