{
	/* For each personality, define values for the communications keys
	 * set up in comms-pack-a.js. To add variety to the comms
	 * messages, most of the definitions are arrays. To allow shared
	 * definitions, as well as the personality-based keys there are
	 * also role-based keys e.g. prefix commsPackA_hunter_ and generic
	 * keys prefixed commsPackA_generic_
	 *
	 * These might be used exclusively - e.g. 
	 * "commsPackA_personality_key" = "[commsPackA_generic_key]"
	 * or as one option of many - e.g.
	 * "commsPackA_personality_key" = (
	 *   "[commsPackA_generic_key]",
	 *   "[commsPackA_role_key]",
	 *   "Some specific message",
	 *   "Another specific message"
	 * );
	 *
	 * That example gives a 50% chance of one of the two specific
	 * messages, a 25% chance of one of the role messages (that key
	 * might well be an array itself), and a 25% chance of a generic
	 * message. Often the personality key might reference the same
	 * generic message twice, to boost the chances - e.g.
	 * commsPackA_personality_key = (
	 *   "[commsPackA_generic_key]",
	 *   "[commsPackA_generic_key]",
	 *   "[commsPackA_generic_key]",
	 *   "[commsPackA_generic_key]",
	 *   "[commsPackA_generic_key]",
	 *   "A specific message",
	 * );
	 * for a 5/6 chance of one of the generic messages, and a 1/6
	 * chance of something more unusual.
